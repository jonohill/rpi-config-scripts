# rpi-packer

Packer template with helper scripts that I use for building RPi images.

Also includes a collection of scripts to install and configure things on Raspberry Pi (Raspbian). Most scripts require environment variables as their input. Some scripts document this, for others you're on your own. No guarantees of API stability.
